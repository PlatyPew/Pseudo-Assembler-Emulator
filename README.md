# Pseudo Assembler Emulator (WIP)
Ever wondered what to do when you have too much times on your hands and too little time for your assignments? Then try creating computers in Minecraft!

## Initialising everything
`/reload`

`/function cpu:makeall`

## Removing everything
`/function cpu:makeclean`

## Running program
`/function cpu:main`

## Notes
Still work in progress and works in `1.12` onwards
